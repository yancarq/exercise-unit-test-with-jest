Most developers today are required not only to write code, but they also need to write code to test their own code ðŸ˜±, yes.. really.

Today we are going to be using the [jest framework](https://jestjs.io/) to create our first tests.

## What is this exercise about?

We are going to be using the Jest library to build a program capable of converting numeric values from one currency to another:

| Function name     | Description                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fromDollarToYen   | Receives a dollar amount and returns equivalent amount in Japan YEN   |
| fromEuroToDollar  | Receives a Euro amount and returns equivalent amount in US Dollar     |
| fromYanToPound    | Reveives a Yan amount and equivalent amount in England Pound          |
